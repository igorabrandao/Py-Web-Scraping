      "\n",
      "\"I shall be delighted to meet them,\" said the prince. \"But tell me,\"\n",
      "he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred\n",
      "to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive\n",
      "of his visit, \"is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke\n",
      "to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts\n",
      "is a poor creature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others\n",
      "were trying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it\n",
      "for the baron.\n",

      "\"Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her\n",

      "\n",
      "As she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovna's face suddenly assumed an\n",
      "expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with\n",
      "sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious\n",
      "patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron\n",
      "Funke, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the\n",

      "Pavlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak he had done of\n",
      "a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him,\n",
      "so she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I often think,\" she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer\n",
      "to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that\n",
      "political and social topics were ended and the time had come for\n",
      "intimate conversation- \"I often think how unfairly sometimes the\n",
      "joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid\n",
      "children? I don't speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don't like\n",
      "him,\" she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her\n",

      "them less than anyone, and so you don't deserve to have them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And she smiled her ecstatic smile.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Don't joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I\n",

      "face assumed its melancholy expression), \"he was mentioned at Her\n",
      "Majesty's and you were pitied....\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What would you have me do?\" he said at last. \"You know I did all\n",
      "a father could for their education, and they have both turned out\n",
      "fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active\n",
      "one. That is the only difference between them.\" He said this smiling\n",
      "in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles\n",
      "round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse\n",
      "and unpleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a\n",

      "is how I explain it to myself. It can't be helped!\"\n",
